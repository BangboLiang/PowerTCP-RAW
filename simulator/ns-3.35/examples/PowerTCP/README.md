# Config

To avoid any directory conflicts, first open `config.sh` and set the value of `NS3` to the FULL path to the current directory. Both Incast and Fairness simulations take only about a few minutes. So you can play around easily. Documentation on workload simulations coming soon.

# Run Incast Simulations

- **Simulations:** Run `./script-burst.sh yes no` in your terminal to launch one-shot simulations for PowerTCP, Theta-PowerTCP, HPCC, TIMELY and DCQCN in a 10:1 incast scenario. The simulation data is written to `dump_burst/` folder in this directory. 
- **Parse results:** Just run `./results-burst.sh` and the results are written to `results_burst/` folder. 
- **Generate plots:** Run `python3 plot-burst.py`. You will need to open `plot-burst.py` and change some paths at the top of the script. Note: script, results, plot. This is the order to run the scripts.

# Run Fairness Simulations

- **Simulations:** Run `./script-fairness.sh` in your terminal to launch fairness test for PowerTCP, Theta-PowerTCP, HPCC, TIMELY and DCQCN. The simulation data is written to `dump_fairness/`. 
- **Parse results:** Run `./results-fairness.sh` and the results can be found in `results_fairness/`. 
- **Generate plots:** Run `python3 plot-fairness.py` to generate figures (pdf and png).
