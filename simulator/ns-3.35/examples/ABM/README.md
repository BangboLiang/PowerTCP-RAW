# ABM Simulations

## Simulations from the paper

Running the following four scripts essentially produces the results for all the simulations in the paper.

- (run-main.sh)[./run-main.sh]
- `run-buffer.sh`
- `run-interval.sh`
- `run-nprio.sh`

The simulation data is then, written to `dump_sigcomm/` folder. To parse the results, run `results.sh`. This produces a data file with all the metrics needed for plots. More details will be updated soon.
